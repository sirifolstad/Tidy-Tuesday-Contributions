```
</div>
This is a dataset from GitHub's Tidy Tuesday project - https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-08 - 
aiming to allow researchers to practice doing R analyses. The data is a subset of 
a larger dataset from https://openpowerlifting.org/data and was shared by Nicole 
Monhait (https://twitter.com/nrmonhait) to the Tidy Tuesday project.

</div>

I am planning to conducting an exploratory analysis, to see what relationships 
I can discover within the data. This is merely an exploration and for me to practice
my data analysis skills on a Wednesday morning. More analyses of hopefully greater 
detail and impact will come later.

</div>

Within this dataset I will be looking at the effect of gender, age, bodyweight
and equipment on the maximum top 3 number of squats that people do.

</div>

I will first import the data

</div>
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ipf_lifts <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-08/ipf_lifts.csv")
```
\vspace{5mm}
**I will use the following packages**: *tidyverse* (Wickham, 2017) - for data visualisation and wrangling;
*visdat* (Tierney, 2017) - to check for missing data;
*ggplot2* (Wickham, 2016) - to create colourful plots; 
*car* (Fox & Weisberg, 2011) - to check for multicollinearity


\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(visdat)
library(ggplot2)
library(car) 
```

\vspace{5mm}
Before doing an analysis, I will check the amount of missing data there is 
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
vis_miss(ipf_lifts)
```
\vspace{5mm}
I have 5.6% missing data in column age, age class, bodyweight, best 3 squats kg, 
best 3 benchpress, and best 3 deadlifts. To clean the data, I will get rid of 
missing data within these columns
\vspace{5mm}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(age))
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(age_class))
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(bodyweight_kg))
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(best3squat_kg))
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(best3bench_kg))
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(best3deadlift_kg))
```
\vspace{5mm}
Then I will check the data again.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
vis_miss(ipf_lifts)
```

\vspace{5mm}

I still have some missing data in division, however it is less than .1 %. I will still filter this out

\vspace{5mm}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ipf_lifts <- filter(ipf_lifts, !is.na(division))
```
\vspace{5mm}
And check the data again
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
vis_miss(ipf_lifts)
```
\vspace{5mm}
Now there is no missing data. I will now view the first rows of the dataset to check that everything looks tidy.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
head(ipf_lifts)
```

**Does gender matter?**

\vspace{5mm}
Let's first look at the effect of gender on squats applying violin plots
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(ipf_lifts, aes(x= sex, y= best3squat_kg, fill= sex)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  geom_jitter(width=.1, alpha=.5) + stat_summary(fun.data="mean_cl_boot")
```

\vspace{5mm}
The averages for women and men for all of these outcomes seem to be slightly 
similar with men having a slightly higher average than women but also a wider
spread
\vspace{5mm}
I will use the ggplot() function to graph our data. Using the "lm" method, I will 
generate a linear model (regression line)
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(ipf_lifts, aes(x = sex, y = best3squat_kg, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
\vspace{5mm}
This visualisation further illustrate an effect of gender on the number of 
squats completed within this sample.
\vspace{5mm}
Let's now see whether number of squats can be predicted by gender. I will first 
create my model that has one predictor (gender)
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ourmodel_sex <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ sex, data = ipf_lifts)
```
\vspace{5mm}
Then I will create my null model with no predictors for comparison.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ourmodel_sex_0 <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ 1, data = ipf_lifts)
```
\vspace{5mm}
Finally, I will compare our models using the anova() function
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
anova(ourmodel_sex_0, ourmodel_sex)
```
\vspace{5mm}
There seems to be an effect of our model. 
\vspace{5mm}
Let's create a plot to check the residuals for our gender model.
\vspace{5mm}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
hist(residuals(ourmodel_sex))
```
\vspace{5mm}
The residuals look normally distributed. Therefore, I will generate some 
coefficients, using the summary() function
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_sex)
```

\vspace{5mm}
Gender seems to be a strong predictor of the model. Females were our reference 
category and the intercept (151.48) therefore corresponds to females. SexM (99.69) 
corresponds to the difference between our reference category and our Males in 
number of squats, meaning that for every 151.48 squats females do, males do 99.69 more.
\vspace{5mm}
I will use the ggplot() function to graph our data. Using the "lm" method, I will 
generate a linear model (regression line)
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(ipf_lifts, aes(x = sex, y = best3squat_kg, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
\vspace{5mm}
This visualisation further illustrate that gender has an effect on the number of 
squats completed within this sample.
\vspace{20mm}

**Does age matter within the genders?**


\vspace{5mm}
I am also interested in knowing whether there are in-group differences for each
gender. I will therefore create two new datasets that filter out the data for 
each gender to be able to look at the differneces occuring within the groups.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ipf_lifts_females <- filter(ipf_lifts, (sex == "F"))
ipf_lifts_males <- filter(ipf_lifts, (sex == "M"))  
```

\vspace{5mm}
Then I will check that the data looks okay for each filtered dataset.

\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
head(ipf_lifts_females)
```
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
head(ipf_lifts_males)
```

\vspace{5mm}
´
I will  plot how people of different ages are squatting within each gender, 
to get a sense of the **shape** of this data. 
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  ipf_lifts, 
  aes(x = age, y= best3squat_kg, colour = age_class)
) +
  geom_point(show.legend = TRUE, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Best 3 Squats") + 
  facet_wrap(~sex) + 
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Best 3 Squats for Women and Men")
```

\vspace{5mm}
My scatterplot illustrates that both genders seem to have a peak at the age of 25
and then decline in how much they are able to squat. As we can see the 
shapes are similar, but the peak is at a lower point for women than for men, which
corresponds rightfully to my previous gender difference findings.. 
The higher the plots the more the squats each contestant is able to do.
\vspace{5mm}
According to this visual model, both men and women seem peak around the age of 24-34.
To know whether or not this is true I will run a linear model.
\vspace{5mm}
First I will create my models separately for each gender
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ourmodel_women_squat <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ age, data = ipf_lifts_females)
ourmodel_men_squat <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ age, data = ipf_lifts_males)
```
\vspace{5mm}
Then I will create a null model for each gender
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
model_women_squat_0 <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ 1, data = ipf_lifts_females)
model_men_squat_0 <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ 1, data = ipf_lifts_males)
```
\vspace{5mm}

Then I will compare my models using the anova() function
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
anova(model_women_squat_0, ourmodel_women_squat)
anova(model_men_squat_0, ourmodel_men_squat)
```
\vspace{5mm}
My ANOVAs suggest the models with all of the predictors are the better models 
for both women and men.
\vspace{5mm}
I will create two histograms to check that my residuals are normally distributed.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
hist(residuals(ourmodel_women_squat))
```

\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
hist(residuals(ourmodel_men_squat))
```
\vspace{5mm}

For women, the residuals appear slightly skewed, whilst for men there is a perfect 
normal distribution.
\vspace{5mm}
I will create some more plots for the women-data to see whether it is appropriate
for the model.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(ourmodel_women_squat)
```
\vspace{5mm}
The data seems appropriate. I will now create some coefficients for both datasets 
using the summary function
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_women_squat)
```
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_men_squat)
```
\vspace{5mm}
For both men and women there seems to be an effect of age. Specifically, the older
women get, the number of squats they do decline with .71. The older men get 
their squat number declines with 1.26. What is also notable is that the intercept
for men is higher (293.96) than for women (173.41), meaning that even though
the number of squats they do decline more rapidly with age, they also peak at a
higher number of squats, which is consistent with our scatterplot

\vspace{5mm}
Now I want to check the weight distribution on the ages within the squatters of 
each gender. Seeing as squatters within both genders do the most squats at 25 
and this declines with age, I am wondering whether the bodyweight of these 
squatters also decline with age.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  ipf_lifts, 
  aes(x = age, y= bodyweight_kg, colour = weight_class_kg)
) +
  geom_point(show.legend = TRUE, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Bodyweight (kg)") + 
  facet_wrap(~sex) + 
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Weight Class for Women and Men")
```
\vspace{5mm}

Our scatterplot illustrates that as age decline from just before 25, so does the 
weight of the squatter. Therefore, I will add this predictor to the linear model.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ourmodel_women_squat_weight <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ age + bodyweight_kg, data = ipf_lifts_females)
ourmodel_men_squat_weight <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ age + bodyweight_kg, data = ipf_lifts_males)
```
\vspace{5mm}
Then I will compare these with the NULL models using the anova() function.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
anova(model_women_squat_0, ourmodel_women_squat_weight)
```
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
anova(model_men_squat_0, ourmodel_men_squat_weight)
```
\vspace{5mm}

Both anova's suggest the models with the predictors are much stronger than the 
null models. Then I will again generate some coefficients 

\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_women_squat_weight)
```
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_men_squat_weight)
```

\vspace{5mm}
The coefficients suggest that for both men and women, age and bodyweight are 
strong predictors of max squats completed. There was a strong negative 
relationship here, where the younger the person is, the larger their bodyweight 
is. This is true for both women and men in this sample.
\vspace{20mm}

**Does type of equipment people use influence for the number of squats they do?**

\vspace{5mm}
Now let's look at what type of equipment people use within each gender
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  ipf_lifts_females,
  aes(x = age, y= best3squat_kg, colour = equipment)
) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.7) + facet_wrap(~equipment) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Best 3 Squats")

```
\vspace{5mm}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  ipf_lifts_males,
  aes(x = age, y= best3squat_kg, colour = equipment)
) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.7) + facet_wrap(~equipment) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Best 3 Squats")
```

\vspace{5mm}
For women, there seems to be a similar amount of raw and single-ply equipments 
used, whilst for men, single-ply seems to generally be used more than raw 
(which is also used a lot). However, a small proportion seems to be using wraps.
\vspace{5mm}
I will create a final linear model for these to see whether equipment is also a 
predictor of number of squats completed.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ourmodel_women_squat_weight_equip <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ age + bodyweight_kg + equipment, data = ipf_lifts_females)
ourmodel_men_squat_weight_equip <- lm(best3squat_kg ~ age + bodyweight_kg + equipment, data = ipf_lifts_males)
```
\vspace{5mm}
Then I will compare these with the NULL models using the anova() function.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
anova(model_women_squat_0, ourmodel_women_squat_weight_equip)
anova(model_men_squat_0, ourmodel_men_squat_weight_equip)
```

\vspace{5mm}
Both anova's suggest the models with the predictors are much stronger than the 
null models.
\vspace{5mm}

I will create a plot for each model to check their residuals.
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
hist(residuals(ourmodel_women_squat_weight_equip))
```
\vspace{5mm}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
hist(residuals(ourmodel_men_squat_weight_equip))
```
\vspace{5mm}

Both residual models look slightly skewed to the left. I will create some more 
plots to see whether the data is appropriate for the models
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(ourmodel_women_squat_weight_equip)
```

\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(ourmodel_men_squat_weight_equip)
```

\vspace{5mm}
The values for both genders seem to be within cook's distance. Finally, I will
check for multicollinearity measured by VIF
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
vif(ourmodel_women_squat_weight_equip)
```
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
vif(ourmodel_men_squat_weight_equip)
```

\vspace{5mm}
There seems to be no multicollinearity, suggesting my results are trustworthy
\vspace{5mm}

Then I will again generate some coefficients 
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_women_squat_weight_equip)
```
\vspace{5mm}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
summary(ourmodel_men_squat_weight_equip)
```

\vspace{5mm}
These models also suggest equipment matters for the number of squats completed, 
with 32.7 more squats being completed when using single-ply equipment for women, 
and 40.6 more squats being completed when using single-ply for men, and 30.8 
more being completed when using wraps for men.
